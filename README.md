# UE5-Tutorials
 Updated tutorials for Unreal Engine 5 by GameDev.tv ()


## Section 1: Warehouse Wreckage
Create as much wreckage in a warehouse using a limited number of projectiles! Once the projectiles are finished, reload the level and play again.

This bit of tutorials introduces Unreal Engine 5 and starts off game development with a bit of blueprint programming. Blueprints are the visual scripting language used to execute code within Unreal.

Lessons I have learned:
- Quite a bit of terms that I was unsure of before.
- Nice refresher into the blueprint system.
- Starting to learn Unreal Engine 5 as I have not played around inside the editor much until now.

## Section 2: Obstacle Assault
Create an Obstacle course, much like Fall Guys, to traverse through using a 3rd person character built with C++. 

This tutorial starts the dive into C++.

Lessons I have learned:
- Just a good refresher on the basics of C++
